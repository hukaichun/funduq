"""What two funduq processes behind a load balancer actually do, today.

The baseline the horizontal-scaling work is measured against (see
design/broker-horizontal-scaling.md, kept in git history at d78d063 rather
than in the tree). Everything here is expected to *fail* on
current code — that is the point. Each scenario prints what happened and what
the design says should happen instead, so the same script becomes the pass/fail
check as each phase lands rather than being thrown away.

    python scripts/probes/probe_multiprocess.py
    FUNDUQ_DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg://… python scripts/probes/probe_multiprocess.py

Two real OS processes, one database, and an LB that round-robins every call
(scripts/probes/cluster.py). An earlier version of this probe ran two `Funduq`
objects in one process, which shares an event loop and therefore proves less
than it appears to.
