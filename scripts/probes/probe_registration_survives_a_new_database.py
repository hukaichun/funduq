"""Can a running provider survive its database being replaced?

The acceptance check for retiring `agent_id`: an agent is (provider_key,
name), both halves of which the provider already holds.

funduq used to mint an id per agent and require a provider to hold it and echo
it back on every claim. That made a provider's whole vocabulary belong to one
particular database. Replace the database and:

- the ids it holds mean nothing to the funduq it is talking to, and it cannot
  re-derive them because only funduq can mint them;
- re-registering does not fix it either — a fresh database mints *fresh* ids,
  and funduq's own in-process worker keeps claiming for the ones it was attached
  with, so recovering meant learning new identifiers from funduq first.

That second point is what this probe pins. It is not "an id changed"; it is
that recovering needed a step nobody had a reason to know about. Issue #37 is
the same root: a provider ran 30 minutes looking healthy while claiming for
ids nobody recognised.

An agent is `(provider_key, name)` now. Both halves come from the provider's
own configuration, so nothing it holds can be invalidated by a database it
never saw. Opening a link again and publishing the same names is the whole
repair — every input to it is the provider's own, and it learns nothing new
from funduq.
