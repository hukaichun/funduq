"""N funduq processes and a hand-rolled load balancer over them.

The second half of the probe fixture (see node.py for the first). A real
deployment puts nginx or a cloud LB in front of several funduq processes; this
is fifty lines that do the part that matters for finding bugs — send each call
to a different process — without introducing a dependency, a config file or a
second thing to install.

**Deliberately harsher than a real load balancer.** This round-robins *every
single call*, with no session affinity and no stickiness of any kind: the call
that starts a run, the worker's claim for it, each event that worker reports,
and the caller's read of the result can all land on four different processes.
Real load balancers are usually kinder than that, and kindness is what makes
this class of bug show up in production six months late instead of here. When
a probe needs a specific node — "boot B *now*, while A is holding a run" — it
asks for one by name (`call(..., node="b")`), because that is a scenario, not
a routing decision.

The processes are real: separate OS processes, spawned with `subprocess`, each
constructing its own `Funduq` with its own engine and its own in-memory broker,
sharing only `FUNDUQ_DATABASE_URL`. That is the whole point — two `Funduq` objects
in one process share an event loop and can be made to look like they work by
accident, which is how the first version of this probe overstated what it had
shown.

Usage:

    async with Cluster(nodes=["a", "b"]) as c:
        run = await c.call({"op": "start_run", ...})     # lands wherever
        await c.call({"op": "funduq_start"}, node="b")     # lands on b
        c.kill("a")                                      # SIGKILL, no cleanup
