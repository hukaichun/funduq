"""What funduq does when a run's row disappears underneath it mid-run.

The acceptance check for splitting `thread_history` into `runs` and
`thread_messages`. Before the split, `run_events.run_id` could not be a
foreign key — the column it needed to reference was not unique in the merged
table — and its comment said the integrity was "enforced at the application
layer instead". Nothing enforced it. This is what that measured:

    wiped the database while the run is live
      report_event      -> True
      caller's stream   -> 2 event(s): ['TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT', 'RUN_ERROR']
      run in database   -> None
      run_events rows   -> 2   ← orphans, belonging to a run that never existed

funduq told the caller a complete story about a run the database had never heard
of, recorded nothing, and did not complain anywhere.

With the split the reference is a real foreign key, so the write fails and is
logged, and the run's stream terminates rather than hanging (see
broker._pipeline, which sends END_OF_STREAM itself precisely because a handler
that raises would otherwise skip its own). Expected now:

      report_event      -> True    (the push is accepted; persistence is what fails)
      caller's stream   -> 0 event(s), terminated
      run in database   -> None
      run_events rows   -> 0

Nothing is relayed because `_handle_relay` persists before relaying, which is
the rule that keeps a caller from seeing an event that was never recorded.
