"""Which ways can a provider — or a caller — be left with no answer at all?

Issue #37 in its original form: `claim_work` returned `[]` both for "nothing
queued right now", where waiting is correct, and for "you own none of these",
where waiting is futile. A provider ran 30 minutes on the second one with its
container healthy, its own logs clean and exit code 0, absent from the roster
entirely.

That call is gone — funduq hands work over now, so nothing asks funduq for
anything — which does not retire the question, it moves it. Silence is still
possible; it just happens somewhere else. This asks where.

Each scenario induces one path and reports what actually happens. It exists to
*disprove predictions*: every reasoned conclusion in this repository's recent
history that was checked by running something turned out different.
