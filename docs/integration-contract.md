# The integration contract: what each party speaks

funduq is a relay. It carries runs to agents, completions to LLM providers,
and answers back to callers — and it does not intervene in what any of
them says: it never decides on a provider's behalf, never interprets a
payload that belongs to two other parties, and never records an outcome
it has not observed. Every other promise on this page is a consequence of
that one.

The contract splits by role, because the promises differ. Callers get
standards, untouched. Providers speak standard *shapes*, and funduq opens
the doors for them — with plumbing that is funduq's own, mandatory, and
published so nobody has to read funduq's source to implement it.

| role | you speak | funduq provides | funduq-invented parts |
|---|---|---|---|
| caller (human UI) | AG-UI, any standard client | the AG-UI endpoint, threads, history | all **opt-in** |
| caller (agent-to-agent) | A2A, any standard client | the A2A endpoint, task lineage | all **opt-in** |
| agent provider | AG-UI shapes: run input in, event stream out | AG-UI **and** A2A facades, both opened by funduq | mandatory, **published as data** |
| LLM provider | OpenAI chat-completion shapes: requests in, chunks out | the OpenAI-compatible endpoint agents call | mandatory, **published as data** |

## Callers: standards, and nothing else required

The user–agent seam is AG-UI; the agent–agent seam is A2A. A standard
client of either — unmodified, no SDK of funduq's, no extra field — works.
That is a hard rule with a test behind it, and it has teeth in both
directions: when funduq seems to need a new field or endpoint, the first
question is whether the protocol already has one, and the answer has
changed designs before.

Everything funduq adds beyond the two standards is **opt-in**: binding a
run to a KYOK offering, attaching an actor chain, any metadata mechanism
funduq invents. Opting out costs nothing — the run behaves as plain
AG-UI/A2A — and opting in is always the caller's explicit act, never an
inference funduq makes. The largest opt-in is the responsibility chain:
a thread whose first run carries an actor chain binds the chain's head
at birth — thereafter only the head or the serving provider may write
to it, and a paused ask on a chained run is answered only with a
signature from those keys (`metadata.resolution`, the
`funduq-resolve:{run_id}:{timestamp}` payload; a session delegation
certificate under `metadata.delegation` lets an ephemeral session key
act for a durable one). A thread opened without a chain keeps the open
behavior on this page forever — a later chained writer cannot lock it.
The mechanics are in
[Responsibility chains](mechanisms/responsibility-chains.md).

One small carve-out keeps the record honest: the metadata keys funduq
itself writes into a run's record (`verifiedActorChain`,
`interrupts`, `failureReason`, and `funduq`, held in reserve) are stripped from caller-supplied metadata at the doors. A
caller cannot plant a forged verification summary — or a fake failure
reason — wearing funduq's handwriting; everything else passes through
untouched.

## Agent providers: speak AG-UI shapes, funduq opens the doors

An agent provider hosts nothing and opens no port. It connects **out** to
funduq — from a laptop, behind NAT, inside a private subnet — and its whole
protocol obligation is a shape: accept a run input that is an AG-UI
`RunAgentInput`, produce AG-UI events back. Both of funduq's caller-facing
doors are opened by funduq on the provider's behalf: the AG-UI endpoint,
and the A2A endpoint — an agent becomes A2A-callable without its author
writing a line of A2A, because funduq translates every A2A call into the
same AG-UI-shaped run input before dispatch. One shape in, two protocols
served.

Around that shape sits plumbing no external standard defines, so funduq
defines it: an Ed25519 identity, signed registration, a challenge-answer
proof when a link opens, a three-valued answer to an offered run. These
are **not opt-in** — they are how a provider exists at all — and the
promise that replaces opt-in is threefold:

1. **minimal** — funduq invents only where no standard exists, and the
   invented surface stays as small as the job allows;
2. **published as data** — every payload, model and byte a provider must
   produce or validate is exported by the provider SDK and pinned in
   [`contract-vectors.json`](contract-vectors.json), replayable in any
   language; an implementation never needs funduq's source;
3. **guarded** — tests fail funduq's own CI when an invented surface goes
   unpublished, so the contract cannot silently grow a private corner.

## LLM providers: serve OpenAI shapes, funduq exposes the endpoint

The same pattern, one seam over. An LLM provider (the party holding a
real key — see [Keep your own key](https://github.com/hukaichun/funduq/blob/d78d0638c0ec2126167240c62471651b5468d35b/design/keep-your-own-key.md)) also connects
out and also promises only a shape: receive a completion request, stream
back OpenAI chat-completion chunks. The OpenAI-compatible endpoint that
agents call is funduq's to expose; the provider behind it is resolved per
call. Policy — serving, refusing, pricing, whose budget a run spends —
is entirely the provider's; funduq relays a structured refusal as data and
never reads it.

The plumbing is the same machinery agent providers use (identity is
identity; one keypair may be both), under the same threefold promise.

## What a standard A2A client observes

"A standard client works unmodified" is a promise about what funduq
*requires*, not a claim that every A2A concept has a funduq meaning. These
are the identifier rules and the current gaps, stated so nobody has to
discover them from behavior.

**Identifiers are funduq's to mint.** A task id is funduq's `run_id`; a
`contextId` is funduq's `thread_id`. Neither is caller-choosable. Omitting
`contextId` on the first call is the correct pattern — funduq generates
one and returns it, and the caller passes it back to continue the
thread. An unknown `contextId` is refused rather than created, because
accepting arbitrary caller-chosen ids would let any party claim a thread
it did not originate. A `contextId` belonging to a different agent is
refused for the same reason.

**`referenceTaskIds` is lineage, not continuity.** The first reference
resolves to its thread and becomes the new thread's parent, which is how
a delegated call hangs off the thread that spawned it. It does *not*
continue that conversation — for that, pass the `contextId`. It grants
nothing, either: a run spends against the KYOK opt-in its **own** caller
submitted, and citing a funded task confers no funding.

**`Message.taskId` references an existing task.** It resolves to that
task's thread, and an unknown one is a JSON-RPC `-32001`. Note it is read
from the message, not from `params`; a `params`-level `taskId` is
ignored and the call starts a fresh thread.

**A resumed run keeps its task id.** A pause does not end a task and
resuming does not mint a successor, so a stored task id stays valid
across the pause.

### Current gaps, stated plainly

These are not design positions. They are what the code does today, and a
client author needs them.

- **Addressing a paused task over A2A rides `taskId`, not
  `elicitationId`.** A message whose `taskId` names the thread's
  `input-required` task resumes it with whatever the message says —
  funduq never checks that it answers the question; a redirection or an
  overrule rides the same road, and the provider judges it from the
  thread's shape. Who may do so is gated by nothing
  more than knowing the id, the same capability-by-identifier trust
  every thread reference carries today (a recorded contradiction, not a
  position). When A2A v1.1's `elicitationId` lands, that is the marker
  this interim rule yields to.
- **A message sent while a run is active becomes its own task,
  delivered alongside.** It is a new task on the thread — never merged
  into the active run and never dropped — and funduq offers it to the
  provider in arrival order without waiting for the active turn to end:
  funduq does not pace a provider's conversation, so whether the new
  turn runs at once, waits, or is folded into the turn in flight is the
  agent's own decision. (The
  [gate-retirement record](design-records.md#the-thread-gate-is-retired-funduq-does-not-pace-a-providers-conversation)
  explains why funduq once made that decision itself, and stopped.)
- **Asking to join a turn in flight is a declared extension, never an
  inference.** Under the interjection extension
  (`https://github.com/hukaichun/funduq/ext/interjection/v1`), a caller
  puts the target task's id in the message's `metadata` under
  `<uri>/addressedRunId`; funduq relays it to the agent as
  `forwardedProps.addressedRunId` and holds no opinion about the
  target's state — the agent judges from its own loop, and an ask that
  lands after the target ended degrades to an ordinary next turn. This
  is *intent*, distinct from AG-UI's `parentRunId` (plain continuation,
  relayed untouched): a `taskId` naming a running task declares
  nothing, because v1.0 defines no meaning for it and funduq will not
  guess. Yields to whatever mid-task carrier A2A ships.
- **The thread's pending buffer is bounded** (`thread_queue_limit`,
  default 8). At the limit a new message is refused loudly —
  `ThreadQueueFull`, meaning NOT accepted, retry after the thread
  drains — never accepted-then-expired. Answering a paused task via
  `taskId` is exempt: the reply is how the buffer drains.
- **funduq mints every thread id, on both doors — the id in funduq's reply
  is the one to continue with.** An unseen AG-UI `threadId` gets a new
  thread under funduq's own id (carried on every returned event); the id
  you sent is deliberately not adopted, so a client that keeps resending
  its own invented id gets a fresh thread each call. A2A's unknown
  `contextId` is a plain `ThreadNotFound`, per its spec's server-assigned
  ids. The asymmetry is each protocol's own grammar; the shared rule and
  its reasoning — funduq is a relay between two owners, and a caller's
  naming rights have no caller identity to scope them to yet — are in
  [the design record](design-records.md#conversation-naming-rights-wait-for-a-caller-to-own-them).
- **An offline agent looks like a failed task, not an error.** The run
  is recorded `failed` with `agent_offline`, and the task comes back
  `FAILED` with no message part.
- **No error becomes a JSON-RPC error in core**, and core writes no
  JSON-RPC at all — not the envelopes, not the method names, not the
  codes. A task id that names nothing raises A2A's own
  `TaskNotFoundError`; a task that is not this agent's comes back as
  `None`, which is what A2A's request-handler interface means by
  not-found. Unknown thread, thread-ownership mismatch, unknown agent,
  invalid actor chain and invalid run input escape as Python exceptions.
  Which code or HTTP status a caller sees is the gateway's choice, and
  it has to be: **the protocol version a caller speaks rides an
  `A2A-Version` header**, so the gateway is the only party holding the
  evidence for that decision (see
  [writing a transport](writing-a-transport.md#serving-the-a2a-door)).
- **Non-lifecycle AG-UI events ride status updates** under a funduq
  metadata key. A standard client ignores them, which means tool-call
  events are not visible over A2A.

## Where the inventions live

What the plumbing actually is — the nine signed payload families, the
link-open challenge, actor chains and what they do and do not prove — is
[Identity is an Ed25519 keypair](mechanisms/identity.md) and
[Actor chain](mechanisms/actor-chain.md). How to carry all of it over a
wire of your own is [Writing a transport](writing-a-transport.md). This
page is the contract; those are the mechanisms it obliges funduq to
publish.
