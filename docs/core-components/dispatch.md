# The dispatch trunk

Part of [core components](../core-components.md).

Four lanes, all network-free — each is a set of methods a serving layer
puts on whatever wire it chooses. This page describes how each lane
actually works, in order of what happens.

## The caller doors: AG-UI and A2A

Starting a run over AG-UI (`protocols/agui.py`) is a straight line:
verify the caller's metadata (an actor chain, if attached, is verified
here and a summary added), create or reopen the thread and run rows,
append the caller's messages to the thread, and check the agent is
currently served — an offline agent fails the run immediately with a
terminal event rather than queueing into silence. Then the run input is
built (below), handed to the broker, and the caller gets back a live
**event stream**: an async iterator that yields each AG-UI event as the
provider produces it — carrying **funduq's** thread id, which is the
authoritative one: a caller-supplied `threadId` funduq does not know is
not adopted, and the substitution rides back on every event rather than
happening silently (see
[conversation naming rights](../design-records.md#conversation-naming-rights-wait-for-a-caller-to-own-them)).
A run on a thread that already has one in flight
is accepted and queued behind it, its stream silent until its turn —
AG-UI has no "accepted, not yet worked on" state to answer with, and an
AG-UI client holds one session per thread, so the unusual second run is
queued rather than refused. Resuming a paused run is the same door with
a `resume` payload — the run keeps its id and its provider is invoked
again, targeting the thread's `input-required` run specifically. Two
callers answering the same question race, and the loser gets a
`ThreadSnapshot` of the thread as it now stands rather than a stream:
the question was already answered, so there is no second resume to
watch.

The A2A door (`protocols/a2a.py`) speaks JSON-RPC with method names read
off the A2A service descriptor (nothing hand-written, so an upstream
rename fails at import). `message/send` creates a thread and run through
the same repository calls, with one deliberate difference: an unknown
`contextId` is refused rather than replaced, because A2A's spec assigns
that id server-side while AG-UI's is client-chosen and required. Task
states are derived from run statuses; `referenceTaskIds`
records lineage; `tasks/cancel` is the one external cancel path. Every
message is kept: one whose `taskId` names the thread's paused
`input-required` task is the answer to its question and resumes that
run (status-guarded, so concurrent replies resolve to one resume); any
other message becomes a new queued run on the thread — including one
sent while a run is active, which waits its turn rather than being
merged, refused, or dropped.

## The translation: A2A becomes AG-UI before dispatch

Both doors converge on one function that builds the AG-UI
`RunAgentInput` the provider will see: thread id, run id, **this run's
own messages** — what the caller just said, appended to the thread's
record on the way past, not the thread's accumulated history (an AG-UI
client sends the conversation it holds; an A2A `message/send` carries
one message and funduq adds nothing to it) — and `forwardedProps` — the caller's free-form slot plus
funduq's own two additions (`caller`, `kyok`), built by a single shared
builder so a run's identity props are byte-identical whichever protocol
dispatched it. An agent therefore becomes A2A-callable without its
author writing any A2A: by the time the run reaches the provider, the
protocol difference has already been erased.

## The agent-provider lane: offer, claim, pipeline

`RunBroker` keeps the live state in memory: a `Run` object per active
run, a pending deque per agent, and a capacity bucket per provider
(declared limit vs in-flight count). A sweep task wakes whenever work
arrives or capacity frees, and makes sure every conversation with pending
runs has a **lane** handing them over. One lane per thread, because a
thread is the one pipe whose delivery order funduq guarantees; the sweep
itself never waits for a provider:

1. **Offer.** The head of the agent's queue is offered to its attached
   connection — one awaited call carrying the claimed-run envelope,
   under a delivery timeout. Arrival order is the only sequencing funduq
   imposes: a thread's utterances are offered in the order they came,
   and a sibling is offered as soon as it reaches the head, whether or
   not an earlier run of that thread is still producing. funduq does not
   pace a provider's conversation — running the new turn at once,
   holding it, or folding it into the turn in flight is the provider's
   own decision, made in the agent author's code (the design record
   [the thread gate is retired](../design-records.md#the-thread-gate-is-retired-funduq-does-not-pace-a-providers-conversation)
   records why funduq once decided this and stopped).
   The provider answers accepted / declined-full /
   refused-permanently; timeouts and refusals are handled per
   [runs and cancels are requests](../mechanisms/requests.md).

   The lane waits here, and only this conversation waits with it: a
   thread's utterances reach the provider in arrival order, because a
   provider that takes turns can only take them in the order they reach
   it. Every other conversation is handing over at the same time in a
   lane of its own, including the other conversations of this same
   agent. The
   run leaves the queue and takes its place on the provider as the offer
   goes out, is recorded `offering` for the length of the wait, and is
   handed back — place and status both — if the answer is not an
   acceptance.
2. **Claim.** An accepted run is marked claimed by that provider's key.
   Its place was already taken at step 1; claiming is when funduq starts
   calling it `running`.
3. **Its own lane.** Each claimed run gets its own consumer task, whose
   first act is to record the claim and which then drains a per-run
   command queue **in order** for the rest of the run's life. Recording
   rather than queueing the claim is what makes the window above safe:
   anything that arrived while the provider was still answering — a
   cancel, typically — is drained after it, so funduq never asks a
   provider to stop a run it has not yet called running. The two owners
   (the dispatch lane, then the run's own) hand over at the one moment
   there is nothing in flight to reorder.

   What the lane then drains: the provider reporting an event becomes a
   relay command (persist the event row, forward it to the caller's live
   stream); finishing the stream folds the run's outcome and writes the
   terminal status; a cancel request is forwarded to the provider's
   `cancel` and the lane keeps running until a terminal command actually
   arrives. Ordering per run is guaranteed by the queue; runs are
   independent of each other.

When a run ends — however it ends — one funnel (`forget`) releases its
state: capacity is freed, the sweep wakes, KYOK bindings die, listeners
are told.

## The LLM-provider lane: the completion relay

The KYOK door (`protocols/kyok.py`) is request-scoped, no queue. A call
arrives bearing the run's token; three checks run in order — the token
verifies and hasn't expired, the run it names is still live for that
agent, and the call is freshly signed by the agent provider's own key
over the token, a timestamp and the body hash. Then the run's binding
names an offering; the offering resolves to whichever connection
currently serves it (attach/re-attach mid-run just works, because the
binding never names a connection); and the provider's chunk iterator is
returned to the caller, wrapped in a counter that records how the stream
ended. Not attached → immediate fast-fail, because the calling agent is
holding a live stream open — queueing here would help nobody.

## One deliverer, and why that is load-bearing

Exactly one place in the process offers a run to a provider: the
broker's dispatch lane. `enqueue_run` and attaching a provider do not
deliver anything — they set a flag that wakes the sweep, which starts
lanes. The call that actually hands a run over has a single call site,
and each conversation has exactly one lane draining it.

That is an invariant, not a coincidence of the current code. Two callers
racing to offer the same head run both plausibly succeed, and the run is
delivered twice or claimed by one provider while the other's ack arrives
against a run already in flight — either way a run is lost or
duplicated, and neither is recoverable from the outcome funduq records.
Anything that needs a run dispatched sooner should wake the sweep, never
deliver on its own.

Lanes running side by side do not weaken this. A lane takes the run off
the queue before the offer leaves, and the run is nobody's to offer
again until it comes back; a second lane for the same thread is never
started while the first is alive. What the lanes share is the provider's
capacity bucket, which is why a place is spent at dispatch — two lanes
reading an in-flight count that only rises on acceptance would both find
room that is not there.

The same rule explains why `enqueue_run` raises when the broker is not
running. Accepting work that nothing will ever dispatch would leave a
run `queued` forever and look, from every vantage point, exactly like a
provider that is merely busy.

## The ack, and the ack that arrives too late

A provider's answer to an offer is three-valued, so the delivery call
returns either a boolean or a refusal carrying the provider's own
reason. A truthy answer claims the run; a falsy one is a transient
decline and the run stays queued; a refusal is permanent and fails the
run with that reason recorded verbatim.

Two clocks bound the wait. A single offer has a **delivery timeout**
(5 s): expiry counts an `unanswered` against the provider and hands the
run back to the queue, because a provider that did not answer has not
refused. An
agent left with **no serving provider** past its window (45 s) has its
queued runs failed `no_provider_took_it`, clocked from the later of when
the run was queued and when the agent went unserved. While a provider is
attached, a queued run waits indefinitely — the window times out the
absence of anyone to ask, not a provider's slowness.

A provider whose answer arrives after funduq gave up can still recover the
run, and the way it does so is by behaving as though it holds it:
reporting an event for a run it does not own is read as a late ack. funduq
accepts it only if the run is still unclaimed *and* the claimant is the
provider currently serving that agent, then counts an `answered_late`
and starts the pipeline. So a slow provider loses a quality counter, not
the work.

## Capacity is per identity, not per agent

The in-flight bucket is keyed by the provider's public key. One provider
serving five agents has one budget across all five, which is the same
answer funduq gives everywhere else: the key is the identity, and how a
provider arranges itself behind it is its own business.

A provider that declines while claiming to have room is counted
`misdeclared` and then treated as full, because its own declaration is
the only capacity figure funduq has and the decline is the more recent
fact. This is also what makes self-delegation deadlock — see
[the design record](../design-records.md#self-delegation-deadlocks-a-capacity-capped-provider).

The quality counters are not just a report — they are **the
allowance**: they say how much abnormality a provider is permitted,
and a provider whose counter reaches it (`provider_quality_tolerance`,
default 3, `None` disables; policy, so a setting) is **withdrawn from
service** — the same judgment for every event type and every provider,
nobody holding a special seat. funduq handles an abnormal provider
rather than cleaning up after one: nothing special happens to its
runs — queued ones stay in the queue like anyone's and, the agent now
unserved, travel the ordinary no-provider expiry road to a loud
failure; runs already in flight finish and report. The way back is
the front door: reconnect and register again, with the record intact
and still counting. (Before this rule, an unlimited provider that kept
declining was re-offered every sweep forever, inflating `misdeclared`
into noise — funduq#128.) Providers that want funduq to pace intake
declare a real limit — that is what the declaration is for — and the
provider SDK keeps the default coherent: a runtime that claims no
limit accepts every delivered run, so it can never be branded abnormal
by its own transport plumbing.

## One substrate under both

A broker and a relay are deliberately different machines — one queues
and negotiates, one passes through — but each keeps the same roster:
a plain map from ref to connection where re-attaching under the same ref
replaces the old link (one connection per role), plus per-identity
counters. That table is extracted once as `LiveRoster` and composed by
both hosts, so the two lanes cannot drift apart; the register / attach /
detach ceremony above them is likewise stated once, in the facade's
`_Roster` base.
