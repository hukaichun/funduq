"""A message sent while a run is active is delivered alongside it — never dropped.

The A2A door used to answer a mid-run message with the in-flight task and
silently discard the message. These tests pin what replaced that: every
utterance becomes its own run, offered to the provider in arrival order —
funduq imposes no turn-taking; sequencing a conversation is the provider's
own decision. Two special lanes ride on explicit declarations: a message
whose `taskId` names the thread's paused `input-required` task resumes that
task (the reply lane), and a run declaring `addressedRunId` (the
interjection extension) asks to join a turn in flight — intent the caller
states, never inferred from the target's state, judged by the agent alone.
