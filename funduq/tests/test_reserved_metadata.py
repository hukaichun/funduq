"""Caller metadata cannot wear funduq's handwriting.

funduq writes a small set of keys into a run's metadata record
(`verifiedActorChain`, `interrupts`, `failureReason`). A caller-supplied
value under any of them is stripped at the doors — otherwise a caller could
plant a forged verification summary, or a fake failure reason, that later
readers would take for funduq's own record. Keys funduq does not write are
plain caller data and pass through untouched.
