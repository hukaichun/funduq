        The run **keeps its id**, because it is the same run: a deferred call is a pause inside
        the agent's loop, not the end of it. The provider sees that pause as an ending — its
        stream really did return — and funduq holds the run's identity across the gap the
        provider cannot hold, invoking the agent again with the result attached and continuing
        the event log from where it stopped.

        Raises `LookupError` if `run_id` doesn't exist, and `NoPendingAsk` if it exists but is
        not waiting for a result — a run that already reached its natural exit has no
        suspension to return to, and running it again would put a second loop under one run's
        id. That is a new run; open one with `start_run`.
