    stream really did end, and what the run is waiting for is the caller's
    own answer — so there is no request to relay and no outcome to observe.
    Saying so is the only honest answer; `cancel_run`'s False means "already
    ended, nobody left to ask", and a run that is still waiting is not that.

    It is deliberately not a way to abandon a pause. Deciding not to answer
    is the answering party giving up, which is a different act from asking a
    worker to stop, and funduq has no verb for it yet. Smuggling it in here
    would make a cancel settle a run funduq has observed nothing about.

    suspended. A run that already exited has no suspension to return to, so
    running it again would be a second loop wearing the first one's id —
    that is a new run, and the caller should open one.

    It is also what a loser sees when two results race for the same pending
    ask: exactly one reopen wins, and the other finds nothing left waiting.
