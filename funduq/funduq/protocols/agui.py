        thread under a **funduq-minted id** — the caller's own id is deliberately not adopted, and
        the `threadId` on every returned event is the authoritative one to continue with (funduq
        owns its record's primary keys; a caller-chosen name has no caller identity to scope it
        to yet — see the design record on conversation naming rights). The caller-supplied
        `run_id` is likewise ignored in favour of funduq's own. A run on a thread
        that already has one in flight is accepted and offered to the provider in arrival
        order; whether the provider runs it immediately, holds it, or folds it into the turn
        in flight is the provider's own decision, and the returned stream stays silent until
        the provider starts producing. An AG-UI client normally holds one session per thread,
        so a second concurrent run is unusual but not refused. A resume with no surviving paused run to target (another caller answered first)
        gets a `ThreadSnapshot` instead of a stream. If the agent is registered but not currently
        served, the run is recorded as failed and the returned stream carries a `RUN_ERROR` event
        rather than hanging. Raises `AgentNotFound` if `agent` isn't registered,
        `LlmProviderNotFound` if a KYOK opt-in names an unknown LLM provider, and
