**funduq is not an agent framework.** It does not write your agent, choose your model, or run your prompts. There is no chain, no graph, and no opinion about how an agent thinks.

**It is the seat between a caller and an agent provider.** It holds the run, records who asked and through whose hands the work passed, and hands the work to whoever is serving — over standard [AG-UI](https://docs.ag-ui.com/) or [A2A](https://a2a-protocol.org/), while implementing neither transport itself. An agent on a laptop, behind NAT, or in a private VPC connects *outbound* and becomes reachable; no public IP, no open ingress port, no tunnel service.

That seat is not a category anyone invented for this. A 2026 survey of agentic-web infrastructure ([arXiv 2606.20570](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2606.20570)) lists as still-unsolved exactly three things: an intermediary between callers and agent providers, responsibility tracked across delegation hops, and a run's lifecycle held by someone other than the two parties.

---

## What it is

A *funduq* is the merchant inn of the old trading cities — the house where traveling merchants, who held no address in town, lodged, stored their goods, did business, and appeared in the house's register. The name is a design stance, unpacked under [Design principles](#design-principles) below.

Concretely, a funduq gateway gives you:

- **Reachability without ingress.** Providers hold a persistent outbound stream to the gateway; work is relayed over it. Nothing on the agent's side listens.
- **Two protocols on one HTTP surface.** AG-UI for human-facing event streaming (SSE) and A2A v1.0 for agent-to-agent JSON-RPC. Both wire vocabularies come from the official packages (`ag-ui-protocol`, `a2a-sdk`) — no field name, enum value, or method name is hand-written, so a spec rename fails at import instead of rotting silently.
- **Keypair identity, no accounts.** Each provider generates a local Ed25519 keypair; registration verifies ownership of the key and issues short-lived session tokens. A caller can confirm it is talking to the same key as last time. There is no user database and no central authority vouching for what an agent *does*.
- **Signed delegation chains.** When agents delegate to agents, each hop carries an EdDSA-signed JWT bound to the previous hop's hash — the delegation path is tamper-evident and auditable.
- **Signing, not transport.** What core guarantees is signing and verification: opening a link answers a single-use challenge, and singular acts (answering a paused run, asking one to stop) carry a signature over the act itself within a 60-second window. An actor-chain hop carries **no time at all** — whether a presentation is live is not a question core can answer, since it sees bytes rather than a live caller, so that belongs to the authenticating seat in front of the door. See [what a deployment has to know](docs/operational-limits.md).
- **Durable threads, runs, and human-in-the-loop.** Persistent conversation state with native `input-required` pause and resume. SQLite by default with zero configuration; one `FUNDUQ_DATABASE_URL` switch moves the same code path to Postgres for multi-writer deployments.
- **Keep Your Own Key** *(experimental)*: a relay that lets callers fund LLM inference with their own API keys without handing the raw credential to agent hosts. See [Keep your own key](docs/mechanisms/kyok.md).
- **A static directory UI** (`funduq-directory`, in funduq-server) to browse registered agents and chat with them live.

## Design principles

A traditional funduq gave a merchant with no address in town the three things it takes to trade there: a place to be reached, a house whose register recorded the dealings, and a keeper who kept the house without meddling in the trades. The keeper did not vouch for anyone's goods — you recognized a merchant because the same face returned to the same house season after season, and trust was earned through reputation and direct experience, not through a central authority's seal of approval. Decentralized trust scales; centralized gatekeeping rebuilds the monopoly you came here to escape.

funduq is that house, built as software. The invariants below are load-bearing in the shipped code:

- **The keeper never speaks in a guest's name.** funduq can *ask* an agent to stop; it cannot make it. A run's outcome is recorded only when observed: a run that finishes despite a cancellation request records `completed`, because that is what happened.
- **The same face, season after season.** Identity is an Ed25519 keypair, not an account — a caller can verify it is talking to the same key as last time, and nobody's seal claims more than that. Sharing a process earns no shortcuts: an in-process provider passes the same registration, identity, and liveness checks a remote one does.
- **The house provides mechanism; the host decides policy.** Open-by-default is funduq's own stance, not a constraint it imposes on deployments: an operator who wants an invite-only or allowlisted deployment puts their own gate in front of `/agents/register` (the reasoning is in [`federation-and-anti-abuse.md`](https://github.com/hukaichun/funduq/blob/d78d0638c0ec2126167240c62471651b5468d35b/design/federation-and-anti-abuse.md), a working note kept in history rather than the tree). The same gateway serves an enterprise-internal deployment and a public one — funduq never takes a side between "open" and "curated".
- **Anyone may walk in.** A stock AG-UI or A2A client works unmodified; every funduq-invented mechanism is opt-in.
- **The core implements no transport, and does not name one.** No market image for this one; it is a codebase discipline, and it is two rules rather than one. The first is about *verbs*: funduq's own code never listens or dials — checked behaviourally (importing the package performs no socket operation at all) and statically (no import of a transport, or of a protocol SDK's I/O half). It deliberately does not police dependency *names*: a wheel may carry network code in its belly — `a2a-sdk` ships `httpx` — and quoting a protocol's own package is exactly how funduq stays current with it. The second rule is about *vocabulary*: which protocol something arrives over is a serving-layer choice, so `broker.py`, `identity.py` and `repo.py` must not name one.

The same principles extend into a conversation-semantics direction that is **designed but not yet implemented** — who may speak on a thread ([responsibility chains](docs/mechanisms/responsibility-chains.md)), when speech gets handled and how to speak to work already in flight ([the two lanes, queueing and interjection](docs/design-records.md#designed-not-built)). Parts of it are under open discussion with the protocol communities: [who answers a delegated `input-required`](https://github.com/a2aproject/A2A/discussions/2148), [the multi-turn gap list](https://github.com/a2aproject/A2A/issues/1992), and [in-flight steering for AG-UI](https://github.com/ag-ui-protocol/ag-ui/issues/2148).

## Two repositories, one boundary

> **What a protocol *says* is core's. How it is *sent*, and *who may say it*, are the gateway's.**

Core holds the vocabulary and the decisions the domain forces — what a task
is, when a run has settled, which turn an answer belongs to — and hands back
objects: an AG-UI event, an A2A `Task`, an OpenAI chunk. It does not produce
bytes for a wire, and it knows no more about a caller than that caller's own
signature proves.

That one line decides most arguments about where something belongs. A JSON-RPC
envelope, an SSE frame, an HTTP status code, a protocol-version header, a rate
limit, an allowlist: all *sent* or *who*, none of them *what*. The mechanism/policy
split runs through the codebase itself, as a hard line between two repos:

| | **funduq** (this repo) | **[funduq-server](https://github.com/hukaichun/funduq-server)** |
|---|---|---|
| **Owns** | The domain: agents, threads, runs, identity, persistence, protocol *translation* | The network: ports, transports, TLS, CORS, endpoints, wire framing, admin surface |
| **Ships** | `funduq` (the network-free core library) + [`funduq-provider-sdk`](funduq-provider-sdk/) and [`funduq-provider-sdk[llm]`](funduq-provider-sdk/) (the two provider-side contracts, also transport-free) | The reference gateway, the transport SDKs (`funduq-agent-sdk`, `funduq-client-sdk`) and the reference providers |
| **May it bind a socket?** | Never. funduq's own code neither listens nor dials — enforced behaviourally and statically by `funduq/tests/test_core_is_network_free.py` | Yes — that is its entire job |
| **Decides who may speak?** | Only what a caller's own signatures prove: a thread bound to a [responsibility chain](docs/mechanisms/responsibility-chains.md) admits its head and the serving provider and refuses the rest. Beyond that, nothing tells core who is on the other end | Yes. Authentication, authorization, rate limits, and whatever gate a deployment wants in front of the door |

Three consequences, recorded in [funduq#27](https://github.com/hukaichun/funduq/issues/27) and load-bearing:

- **No network design originates here.** When a need looks network-shaped, it becomes a core mechanism *plus* a serving decision made downstream — never a new endpoint, transport, or subproject in this repo.
- **The wire contract is authored downstream.** funduq-server's [`docs/server-mode.md`](https://github.com/hukaichun/funduq-server/blob/main/docs/server-mode.md) is the spec of record (single HTTP port; WebSocket relays for providers and KYOK bridges). The SDKs here *implement* that contract; they do not define it.
- **Core's own vocabulary is transport-neutral.** A worker "claims work and reports events" — whether a gRPC stream, a WebSocket, or an in-process call carries that is not core's business, and no core module may program against one.

That is precisely the runtime architecture:

```
                           Public Internet
                               │
┌──────────────────────────────▼────────────────────────────────┐
│              Your Funduq gateway (funduq-server)               │
│        one HTTP surface · relay engine · funduq core inside      │
│                SQLite / Postgres durable state                 │
└──────┬─────────────────────────────────────────┬──────────────┘
       │ HTTP (AG-UI SSE / A2A JSON-RPC)          │ Outbound-only persistent streams
       │ any caller can reach                     │ providers connect outbound to
       ▼                                          ▼
 ┌─────────────┐   ┌───────────────┐   ┌──────────────┐   ┌────────────────────┐
 │ Browser /   │   │ External Agent│   │ Alice's Agent│   │ Bob's Agent        │
 │ Web UI      │   │ (A2A Caller)  │   │ (Laptop/NAT) │   │ (Private VPC)      │
 └─────────────┘   └───────────────┘   └──────────────┘   └────────────────────┘
```

The relay channel's contract is core's provider port — offer / report events / finish, plus a cancel notification — and is deliberately transport-neutral. Today's carrier is a WebSocket on the gateway's one HTTP port (spec: funduq-server's `docs/server-mode.md`); it was a gRPC stream once, and core was untouched by the swap — which is the test of whether this boundary is real.

## Quick start (library development)

**Running anything is [funduq-server](https://github.com/hukaichun/funduq-server)'s quick start, not this repo's** — the gateway, the provider and caller SDKs, the reference providers, deployment, Docker, and TLS guidance all live there; it owns both ends of every wire it defines. What lives *here* is the library those wires carry, and it needs no gateway at all:

```bash
cd funduq && uv sync --group dev
uv run pytest        # SQLite, zero config
```

The same suite runs against Postgres by pointing at one — dialect bugs only ever appear on one side, so run both before merging (this repo's own `docker compose` carries only a Postgres for exactly this):

```bash
docker compose up paradedb -d
FUNDUQ_DATABASE_URL="postgresql+psycopg://funduq:funduq@localhost:5433/funduq" uv run pytest
```

Schema changes are Alembic revisions packaged under [`funduq/funduq/alembic/`](funduq/funduq/alembic/) — `uv run alembic upgrade head`, run from `funduq/`, is a deploy-time DDL step, deliberately separate from anything a running gateway does (see `CONTRIBUTING.md`). Deployments that will not let an application migrate its own database have [three supported tiers](docs/core-components/persistence.md).

---

## Where it sits

We know of nothing that occupies this exact intersection — outbound-only reachability, AG-UI and A2A on one gateway, keypair identity with signed delegation, durable state with pause/resume. But each neighbor does its own thing better than funduq does:

- **a2a-relay** is a much smaller outbound-WebSocket forwarder. If all you need is A2A passthrough with a shared relay token and no state, it is the simpler tool.
- **[agentgateway.dev](https://agentgateway.dev/)** is a serious ingress data plane — Cedar-based RBAC, observability, MCP support, Kubernetes-grade deployment. Funduq has none of that. The trade is that it assumes your backends are already reachable; funduq exists for when they are not.
- **Cloudflare AI Gateway** and the cloud agent platforms (**AWS Bedrock AgentCore**, **Google Vertex / Agent Marketplace**) give you managed operations, billing, and SLAs that a self-hosted gateway never will. The trade is that your agents live inside their cloud and their identity model.

The full comparison, including DID standards and MCP tunnels, is in [`prior-art.md`](https://github.com/hukaichun/funduq/blob/d78d0638c0ec2126167240c62471651b5468d35b/design/prior-art.md) — a working note kept in history rather than the tree, so parts of it have aged.

## Repository structure

Modular, independent distributions — no shared workspace, each stands alone:

| Module Path | Description |
|---|---|
| [`funduq/`](funduq/) | **The core library.** Agents, threads, runs, identity, the AG-UI/A2A/KYOK adapters, and SQLite/Postgres persistence. Network-free: it depends on no web framework, no gRPC, no WebSocket library — and cannot, by packaging and by test |
| [`funduq-provider-sdk/`](funduq-provider-sdk/) | **What an agent provider and funduq agree on**, from the provider's side: identity and what it signs, the port an agent implements, and the provider's own worker loop. Carries no transport — its dependencies are `cryptography`, `pyjwt` and `ag-ui-protocol` (the event vocabulary), and not `funduq`. See its [README](funduq-provider-sdk/README.md) |
| [`funduq-provider-sdk/`](funduq-provider-sdk/) | **What an LLM provider and funduq agree on** — the party answering KYOK completions: the port, the delivered-completion envelope, the structured refusal, its own registration payloads. Depends on `funduq-provider-sdk` (identity is shared) and `openai` (types only), not `funduq`. See its [README](funduq-provider-sdk/README.md) |
| [`docs/`](docs/) | The published site — the [integration contract](docs/integration-contract.md), funduq's mechanisms, core components, the SDKs, [writing a transport](docs/writing-a-transport.md), the [design records](docs/design-records.md) (why funduq is shaped this way, including the shapes it had first), and [`contract-vectors.json`](docs/contract-vectors.json), the byte-level authority behind them |

Several names circulate and they are different packages: **`funduq-provider-sdk` and `funduq-provider-sdk[llm]` are here** and define the interaction; `funduq-agent-sdk` (a client for the gateway's provider WebSocket) and `funduq-client-sdk` (the caller's side) live in [funduq-server](https://github.com/hukaichun/funduq-server), along with the reference providers (`agent-template`, `providers/*`) and the directory UI (`funduq-directory`). The gateway repo owns both ends of every wire it defines, and the clients and examples live with the stack they front.

## Roadmap

- **WebSocket relay base mode**: one gateway port for callers *and* providers — landed. Spec, serving implementation and the SDK transports all live in funduq-server ([`docs/server-mode.md`](https://github.com/hukaichun/funduq-server/blob/main/docs/server-mode.md)); the gRPC carrier and its `proto/funduq.proto` are retired.
- **Cross-funduq discovery**: `@funduq` addressing (`agent@funduq.example.com`) with client-side resolution and a `.well-known/funduq-federation.json` discovery document — no inter-funduq server-to-server proxying needed. See [`federation-and-anti-abuse.md`](https://github.com/hukaichun/funduq/blob/d78d0638c0ec2126167240c62471651b5468d35b/design/federation-and-anti-abuse.md).
- **Native monetization and payments**: integration with micro-payment rails like [x402](https://www.x402.org/) for agent-to-agent transactions and directory-listing economics.
- **Horizontal gateway scaling**: distributing broker state via Redis / Postgres LISTEN-NOTIFY for multi-replica deployments. The measured baseline and the lease design are in [`broker-horizontal-scaling.md`](https://github.com/hukaichun/funduq/blob/d78d0638c0ec2126167240c62471651b5468d35b/design/broker-horizontal-scaling.md), a working note kept in history. That note's baseline is stale; the current one — 0 of 8 scenarios, measured 2026-08-27 against two real processes on SQLite and Postgres alike — and what each scenario was, are in [operational limits](https://hukaichun.github.io/funduq/operational-limits/).
- **Public key revocation**: a `revoked_keys` blocklist checked at registration and actor-chain verification, so a leaked provider/caller Ed25519 key can be shut out immediately instead of waiting for its holder to stop using it. Written to only by whoever already has direct DB access — no new admin/auth surface inside funduq itself, consistent with funduq having no account system at all.

*Directions, not commitments — the federation/anti-abuse items above are
design proposals only (see that doc's own header), not implemented and
not scheduled. If one of these matters to you, open an issue rather than
assuming it's already underway.*
